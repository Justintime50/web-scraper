# Python Web Scraper
A simple Python web scraper template I'll use for future projects.

## Installation
For the Beautiful Soup script, you'll need PIP and Beautiful Soup:

```bash
pip install beautifulsoup4
```

## Usage
Edit the scripts to suit your needs and run the script.

- `regex-scraper.py` - simple regex web scraper, quick and dirty approach.
- `beautiful-soup-scraper.py` - additional customization options available with Beautiful Soup.

Run the scripts by typing `python` followed by the path of your script in a terminal.

## Attribution
Code based on the project from [Engineer Man](https://github.com/engineer-man/youtube/tree/master/042) - will be modifying in the future.
